# Conda Incubator Logo Guidelines
These guidelines are meant to help keep the Conda Incubator logo consistent and recognizable across all its uses. They also provide a common language for referring to the logos and their components.

The primary logo is the combination of the logomark and wordmark next to each other. The logomark is the circular shape alone (no text) and the wordmark is only the text. It's preferable to use the primary logo whenever possible, and the other two options when it works better for the available space.

## Color
The full color options are a combination of green (`#3db049`) and yellow (`#ffae39`) or orange (`#ff6f0d`), while light options are white (`#FFFFFF`) and dark options black (`#000000`).

Whenever possible, use the full color logos. One color logos (light or dark) are to be used when full color will not have enough contrast, usually when logos must be on colored backgrounds or are being reproduced somewhere that doesn't support color.

## Type
The Conda Incubator wordmark is made from a modified version of League Mono Bold (by Tyler Finck for the The League of Moveable Type @theleagueof). 

## Minimum Size
For consistent legibility, please do not display the primary logo at less than 60px wide, the logomark at less than 15px wide, or the wordmark at less than 50px wide.

## Logo Integrity 
A few other notes to keep in mind when using the logo:
- Make sure to scale the logo proportionally.
- Maintain a good amount of space around the logo. Donâ€™t let it overlap with text, images, or other elements.
- Do not try and recreate or modify the logo. For example, do not use the logomark and then try to write Conda Incubator in another font.
